# Columbia Pages

Publish useful HTML and return the shareable URL. Let the content determine the
composition; the house theme supplies a restrained visual system without
requiring every page to look the same.

## Preflight

Run `cpages status` before writing the page. Continue only when it exits
successfully and the `Auth` line says `authenticated`. If it is not configured,
ask the user to run `cpages login --server <url>`.

Published pages are public to anyone with the unguessable URL. Do not publish
secrets or private source material unless the user explicitly intends to share
it that way.

## Publish

Prefer stdin for a page created once:

```bash
cpages create --title "Quarterly review" - <<'HTML'
<header>
  <h1>Quarterly review</h1>
  <p class="dek">Performance, open decisions, and the next set of actions.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The program is on track, with one decision needed this week.</p>
</section>
HTML
```

Use a temporary file when you expect to inspect or revise the page before
publishing:

```bash
f="$(mktemp)"
# Write body HTML to "$f".
cpages create --title "Quarterly review" "$f"
rm -f "$f"
```

The command prints the page URL. Return that URL to the user.

## Hard Contract

- Default to themed mode. Supply body content only: no `doctype`, `html`,
  `head`, `body`, or `style` elements.
- Use `--raw` only for a complete HTML document that genuinely needs custom CSS
  or JavaScript.
- Put every flag before positional arguments.
- Escape external or user-provided text before inserting it into HTML. The
  server trusts publisher HTML and does not sanitize it.
- Do not invent authorship, dates, confidentiality labels, or status metadata.

## Compose The Page

Start with semantic HTML. Use themed components only when they improve the
content:

- Add a `.page-layout` section navigation for longer reports that benefit from
  scanning, usually four or more major sections.
- Add a callout when there is a real conclusion, recommendation, or risk.
- Use stat blocks for a small set of meaningful comparable metrics.
- Use tables for comparison, with captions and numeric alignment where useful.
- Keep metadata and footers optional.

Read [references/components.md](references/components.md) when you need the
component markup or accessibility details. Plain headings, paragraphs, lists,
links, quotes, code, and tables are all valid without additional decoration.

## Raw Mode

Write a complete document and pass `--raw`. Link the same-origin house theme
when useful:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme.css">
```

Raw pages may run JavaScript. Use them only for trusted content and keep all
external text escaped or safely rendered.

## Manage Pages

```bash
cpages list
cpages get <id>
cpages update <id> "$f"
cpages update --ttl 0 <id>
cpages delete <id>
```

Use `--json` on read commands when structured output is helpful. After creating
or updating a page, verify the command succeeded and return its printed URL.
